              <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
              <p>
              The goal of the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek (DDB) is to offer everyone unrestricted access to Germany&rsquo;s cultural and scientific heritage, that is, access to millions of books, archived items, images, sculptures, pieces of music and other sound documents, as well as films and scores, from all over Germany. As a central, national portal, the DDB is aiming to bring together and network digital content from all of Germany&rsquo;s cultural and scientific institutions. The DDB should secure Germany&rsquo;s connectivity and competitiveness in the areas of science, research and education, but also make it possible for anyone to access Germany&rsquo;s unique cultural heritage and knowledge conveniently via one central point of entry.

              <h2>INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROJECT</h2>
              <div>
                <p>
                In the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek project, my role was defined as: Front-end Developer/Technology Consultant. At the begin of the project I was involved in the selection of the right technologies to use. In this step we decided to go for Grails as development framework, and jQuery plus Twitter Bootstrap for the pure front-end side (one of the requirements was to build a responsive web-application).
                </p>
                <p>
                In the development phase I was focused mainly on the creation of the  entire search results page. This was the heaviest, and the most critical page of the entire project (since it is essentially a search engine). I had to work on both the pure front-end side and the business logic side.
                </p>
                <p>
                During the development of this page, I had to extend a first prototype of the widget used for filtering the results. The new developed widget has become, after this project, an asset reused in other products.
                There have been many constraints related to the UI:
                </p>
                <p>
                &#9679; The general look and feel of the application was already defined by an external design company<br>
                &#9679; Each page should have a minimum of 90/100 points in the Accessibility test <br>
                &#9679; Support for devices equipped with the Android operating system from version 2.3.1<br>
                &#9679; Support the versions 7 and 8 of Microsoft Internet Explorer
                </p>
