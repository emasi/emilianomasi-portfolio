              <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
              <p>ShowOn is a startup that I have co-founded around 3 years ago when I was getting my Master&rsquo;s Degree in Computer Engineering. It is a vertical social network that has as main target the entire dance world (dancers, choreographers, teachers, dance crews, dance theaters, clothing manufacturers, and so forth). The actual web-application counts more than 20k registered users coming from all around the world, with an average daily visits of 300 visitors. Since 8 months the technical development process has been stopped because we reached in our roadmap the main set of feature to be developed for a working stable prototype.</p>

              <h2>INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROJECT</h2>
              <div>
                <p>
                My role was entirely focused on the front-end development of the application and on the product branding appearance (logo, colors, and graphic for the marketing/promotion).
                </p>
                <p>
                In the first six months I worked alone on all the definition and the implementation of the presentation layer. When the features set was starting to grow a lot (including the number of bugs to fix) we decided to hire other freelancers (first of all friends) to help us to be aligned with our roadmap. In that phase, after a bit of teaching on the product itself, I created a team of 3 resources for the frontend development. In that way I had more time to spend in the design and in the creation of new components, and more time to redesign the old crappy ones.
                The process was split roughly in that way:
                </p>
                <p>
                1 - After a meeting with a small group representing our users, go through their needs to externalize possible new features, and issues or improvement to the already implemented ones.
                </p>
                <p>
                2 - Sketch some mocks, create a flow, and then make another meeting with our users sample to check how they react to the proposals. Collect their reactions and adjust what we did with the possibility to go through this step again.
                </p>
                <p>
                3 - Design the HTML structure of the components, or adjust the already existing ones. Defining how the JavaScript should interact with it and do a brief discussion on how the code should look like.
                </p>
                <p>
                4 - After the creation of a new feature branch in our development system, do a final check with the users sample.
                </p>
                <p>
                From a management point of view, I had also to coordinate my team by planning the sprints and by scheduling the right amount of tasks for each developer according to their available time spans and skills. Everything was at the same time influenced by the available economic budget for the current release. To manage all these constraints I decided to adopt a SCRUM-like development approach to be in sync with our deadlines, and a tasks based payment method. I gave a weight for each feature/task depending on its estimated completion time, and on its estimated complexity. These metrics gave to each task a specific amount of money. Each developer was paid at the end of the release by making a sum of all the credits assigned to the solved tasks.
