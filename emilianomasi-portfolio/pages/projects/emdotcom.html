              <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
              <p>
              The main goal of that project is to show to people or organizations how I work, what are my artistic, creative, and development skills, and how much I&rsquo;m able merge them all together. In that webpage you will find a brief presentation on who I am and what are my points of view on the technology field, a timeline showing the main events of my working life, and some useful links to know more about my everyday life. 
              Summarizing, this is my interactive business card.

              <h2>INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROJECT</h2>
              <div>
                <p>
                The reasons behind this project are essentially focused in having a product able to communicate in deep who I am. First of all I decided to go through a one page website, because I wanted to stress the fact that this page is like a business card, and scrolling down the content,  the visitor starts to know me. More it scrolls down, and more its picture of me gets enriched.
                </p>
                <p>
                I believe that there are three different knowledge layers that you can get from my personal web page.
                </p>
                <p>
                The first one is related to my visual taste, and my way to bundle the information in a very clear manner. A simple layout with effective use of colors. Each section (About me, Timeline, and Contacts) is spaced from the previous one by a breaking section used to enrich my definition as a creative engineer.
                </p>
                <p>
                The second layer is related to my front-end development skills concerning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In fact, the code in that project explains in a straightforward manner how  I use the previous mentioned technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                The third and last layer is related to my back-end development skills concerning the MVC pattern, and the creation of a modularized REST webservice.
                </p>
