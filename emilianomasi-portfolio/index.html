            <h1>I Am Emiliano Masi</h1>
            <p>
              I like to define myself as Creative Engineer. Both these two words are very important to understand really who I am and what’s my mission.
              I’m an Engineer because I believe that through the technological development, the quality of life can be greatly improved.
              I’m a creative person because I believe that the technology to support actively the every day life, needs to be innovative and at the same time easy and pleasant to use for
              everybody.
              Bring together creativity, design, and efficient solutions to delight people with amazing creations in this new technology era is my
              mission.

                    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
                    <p>ShowOn is a startup that I have co-founded around 3 years ago when I was getting my Master’s Degree in Computer Engineering. It is a vertical social network that has as main target the entire dance world (dancers, choreographers, teachers, dance crews, dance theaters, clothing manufacturers, and so forth). The actual web-application counts more than 20k registered users coming from all around the world, with an average daily visits of 300 visitors. Since 8 months the technical development process has been stopped because we reached in our roadmap the main set of feature to be developed for a working stable prototype.</p>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <div class="involvement">
                  <h2>INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROJECT</h2>
                  <div class="column-wrapper">
                    <p>
                    My role was entirely focused on the front-end development of the application and on the product branding appearance (logo, colors, and graphic for the marketing/promotion).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In the first six months I worked alone on all the definition and the implementation of the presentation layer. When the features set was starting to grow a lot (including the number of bugs to fix) we decided to hire other freelancers (first of all friends) to help us to be aligned with our roadmap. In that phase, after a bit of teaching on the product itself, I created a team of 3 resources for the frontend development. In that way I had more time to spend in the design and in the creation of new components, and more time to redesign the old crappy ones.
The process was split roughly in that way:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    1 - After a meeting with a small group representing our users, go through their needs to externalize possible new features, and issues or improvement to the already implemented ones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    2 - Sketch some mocks, create a flow, and then make another meeting with our users sample to check how they react to the proposals. Collect their reactions and adjust what we did with the possibility to go through this step again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    3 - Design the HTML structure of the components, or adjust the already existing ones. Defining how the JavaScript should interact with it and do a brief discussion on how the code should look like.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    4 - After the creation of a new feature branch in our development system, do a final check with the users sample.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    From a management point of view, I had also to coordinate my team by planning the sprints and by scheduling the right amount of tasks for each developer according to their available time spans and skills. Everything was at the same time influenced by the available economic budget for the current release. To manage all these constraints I decided to adopt a SCRUM-like development approach to be in sync with our deadlines, and a tasks based payment method. I gave a weight for each feature/task depending on its estimated completion time, and on its estimated complexity. These metrics gave to each task a specific amount of money. Each developer was paid at the end of the release by making a sum of all the credits assigned to the solved tasks.

                     The goal of the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek (DDB) is to offer everyone unrestricted access to Germany’s cultural and scientific heritage, that is, access to millions of books, archived items, images, sculptures, pieces of music and other sound documents, as well as films and scores, from all over Germany. As a central, national portal, the DDB is aiming to bring together and network digital content from all of Germany’s cultural and scientific institutions. The DDB should secure Germany’s connectivity and competitiveness in the areas of science, research and education, but also make it possible for anyone to access Germany’s unique cultural heritage and knowledge conveniently via one central point of entry.

                    <h2>INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROJECT</h2>
                    <p>
                    In the Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek project, my role was defined as: Front-end Developer/Technology Consultant. At the begin of the project I was involved in the selection of the right technologies to use. In this step we decided to go for Grails as development framework, and jQuery plus Twitter Bootstrap for the pure front-end side (one of the requirements was to build a responsive web-application).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In the development phase I was focused mainly on the creation of the  entire search results page. This was the heaviest, and the most critical page of the entire project (since it is essentially a search engine). I had to work on both the pure front-end side and the business logic side.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    During the development of this page, I had to extend a first prototype of the widget used for filtering the results. The new developed widget has become, after this project, an asset reused in other products.
There have been many constraints related to the UI:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    &#9679; The general look and feel of the application was already defined by an external design company<br>
                    &#9679; Each page should have a minimum of 90/100 points in the Accessibility test <br>
                    &#9679; Support for devices equipped with the Android operating system from version 2.3.1<br>
                    &#9679; Support the versions 7 and 8 of Microsoft Internet Explorer

                    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
                    <p>
                     The main goal of that project is to show to people or organizations how I work, what are my artistic, creative, and development skills, and how much I’m able merge them all together. In that webpage you will find a brief presentation on who I am and what are my points of view on the technology field, a timeline showing the main events of my working life, and some useful links to know more about my everyday life. 
Summarizing, this is my interactive business card.

                    <h2>INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROJECT</h2>
                    <p>
                    The reasons behind this project are essentially focused in having a product able to communicate in deep who I am. First of all I decided to go through a one page website, because I wanted to stress the fact that this page is like a business card, and scrolling down the content,  the visitor starts to know me. More it scrolls down, and more its picture of me gets enriched.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I believe that there are three different knowledge layers that you can get from my personal web page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The first one is related to my visual taste, and my way to bundle the information in a very clear manner. A simple layout with effective use of colors. Each section (About me, Timeline, and Contacts) is spaced from the previous one by a breaking section used to enrich my definition as a creative engineer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The second layer is related to my front-end development skills concerning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In fact, the code in that project explains in a straightforward manner how  I use the previous mentioned technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The third and last layer is related to my back-end development skills concerning the MVC pattern, and the creation of a modularized REST webservice.
